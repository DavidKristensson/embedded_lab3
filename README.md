I have decided to reconfigure my Tritech Arduino shield for this assignment.
The potentiometer works as is and does not need configuration.
Arduino pin 2 and 8 have been connected through jumper cables to use the switch and 10k resistor connected to ground.
Arduino pin 6, 11 and 12 have been connected with jumper cambles on a breadboard.
With pin 12 connected i have access to a 10k resistor connected to ground.
